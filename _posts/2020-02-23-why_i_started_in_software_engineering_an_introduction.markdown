My name is Joel Hobgood, I’m 33 years old living in the Southeast and am coming up on my one year wedding anniversary in just over two months, and I am ready for a career change.

I have been working in the customer service industry since I was 16, and have been in the coffee industry for the last 10 as a barista, then to management as shift supervisor at a large corporate coffee chain (I'm sure you can all guess the company. Heck, you might even be sitting in one as you read this blog post! I left to manage a small, local specialty coffee bar that was named Imbibe Magazine’s 2017 Coffee Bar of the Year my first year there, and now I'm working in Production and Fulfillment on the wholesale coffee roasting side of the business for that same coffee company. My background is coffee, and I love the pace and the incredible people I've served and had the honor to work alongside. But it's time for a change.

I was a Computer Engineering major for a year as a college student at Clemson University back in 2005—I’ve always loved computers—but convinced myself I would have to trade working with people—I’ve also always loved being around people—for working alone at a desk or in a cubicle for the rest of my life. I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Psychology, but have always wondered what my career could have been like had I stuck it out with my original choice as a Computer Engineer. After weeks of research and dreaming of trying something new vocationally, I found Flatiron School. And here I am, getting back into the coder's chair to step to embark on a journey to that career-that-could-have-been and make it into the career-I-know-and-love. I am humbled to be a student at Flatiron School, where I have experienced nothing but encouragement and support. I can tell this was a fantastic decision, and I ready to not just change careers, but flourish in a new career in technology.


I had a lot fun in my Programming in C courses back in college and have dabbled in my own web development projects through the years, but nothing more than a small hobby’s worth of work. I am ready to expand and begin harnessing a more professional orientation and skill set with my computer and coding skills. My work days at my current job are long and are spent mostly on my feet with repetitive tasks and can be very tiring and physically exhausting, and it has left me in certain cases with time only later in the evenings to work on the curriculum (if you couldn't tell by my submit time for my blog post!), but my experience thus far has been extremely enjoyable.

I can't wait to see what the future holds for me and the rest of the cohort as we continue on our journeys towards Graduation Day!
